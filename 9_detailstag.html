                        <p>📝 Ingredients (Makes ~20 idlis)

                            2 cups idli rice (or parboiled rice)

                            1 cup urad dal (split black gram, skinless)

                            ½ tsp fenugreek seeds (optional but recommended)

                            Salt to taste

                            Water as needed

                            Oil (for greasing molds)

                            🥣 Step-by-Step Method
                            1️⃣ Soak

                            Wash rice thoroughly and soak for 4–6 hours.

                            Wash urad dal + fenugreek seeds and soak separately for 4 hours.

                            2️⃣ Grind

                            Grind urad dal first with little water until smooth and fluffy.

                            Grind rice to a slightly coarse texture.

                            Mix both batters together in a large bowl.

                            Add salt lightly (some prefer adding after fermentation).

                            Batter should be thick but pourable.

                            3️⃣ Ferment

                            Cover and keep in a warm place for 8–12 hours.

                            Batter should rise and become airy.

                            4️⃣ Steam

                            Grease idli molds with oil.

                            Pour batter into molds.

                            Steam in an idli steamer or pressure cooker (without whistle) for 10–12 minutes.

                            Insert a toothpick — if it comes out clean, idlis are ready.

                            5️⃣ Serve

                            Let cool for 2 minutes, then remove with a spoon.

                            Serve hot with:

                            Coconut chutney

                            Sambar

                            Drain completely.

                            2️⃣ Grind

                            Grind dal with very little water to a smooth, thick, fluffy batter.

                            Batter should be thick enough to hold shape (not runny).

                            Add salt, green chilies, ginger, onion, curry leaves, coriander, and pepper.

                            Mix gently.</p>

                        OR deep fry on low flame until cooked through.

                        3️⃣ Crush

                        Let them cool slightly.

                        Break and grind coarsely (not too fine).

                        4️⃣ Sweeten
