                        Soft, mushy, light and delightful. Khandvi is one of the most likeable Gujarati breakfast recipes a person can have. Khandvi, among the famous Gujarati dishes, gives an irresistible sweet and salty taste with a batter that consists of gram flour, salt, and sugar. Another name given to it in Marathi is ‘Suralichya vadya’ as it is adorned by Gujaratis and Maharashtrians alike.</td>

                <td><h1>2. Dhokla: Spongy Squares</h1> 
                Arguably the most recognizable Gujarati food, Dhokla is one of the most frequently consumed Gujarati dishes in the world. Be it early morning, late afternoon, or evening- it’s always the right time for Gujarati cuisine lovers to eat Dhokla.

A spongy dish made of fermented rice and chickpeas, Dhokla is best consumed with Green Chutney (made of coriander or mint) or Meethi Chutney (made of Dates and Tamarind). Another delicious sweet and salty Gujarati cuisine, Dhokla is often consumed after frying it with mustard, cumin seeds, and curry leaves to add a rich aroma to the dish.

                Handvo is a sweet and savoury cake that gives a depth of flavour and creativity to Gujarati cuisine. The vegetable cake is cooked with a filling of bottle gourd, crushed peanuts, and sometimes an assortment of other vegetables added according to taste. The cake is considered slightly similar to Dhokla in terms of texture, but where it differentiates is in taste. To prepare Handvo, Gujaratis use a different type of pressure cooker to make the dish after applying a tadka of oil, cumin seeds, mustard, and curry leaves. Among the lip-smacking Gujarati dishes for dinner, Handvo ranks at the top as it is a must-have dessert for all.

                Straight out of the Gujarati dry snacks recipes book comes Gathiya- a deep-fried snack made of chickpea flour. The snack, after preparation, is soft, not crisp, and retains its powdery texture. Since Gujarati dishes are incomplete without a few sweeteners, the alternative version of this snack is called Mitha Gathiya. This dish is often consumed by people while having tea in the morning, or the evening. So, if you are looking for exotic Gujarati veg dishes that serve as snacks, you know what to have- Gathiya.</td>

</h1>
                 A very commonly consumed Gujarati food, Thepla is a flatbread prepared in multiple variations like with fenugreek leaves, wheat flour, or cumin seeds. With the right combination of ingredients in the Thepla dough, the dish comes out with a vibrant flavour that is nearly impossible to ignore. Combined with add-ons like curds and chunda, Theplas are a popular portable dish that can be consumed hot or cold while travelling. As food lovers, you may not wish to regret missing Gujarati special dishes, especially Thepla, as it satiates one with the authentic taste and style.</td>

                <td><h1> 1.Paneer Butter Masala Recipe</h1>
               Also called Butter Paneer, this curry is made with paneer cubes simmered in a classic makhani gravy of tomatoes, cashews, butter, and cream.

The curry sauce is smooth and creamy with a mild sweetness that balances the tang of tomatoes, while butter and cream add richness.

Unlike spicier gravies such as Paneer Tikka Masala or Kadai Paneer, Paneer Butter Masala is gentler in heat and has a distinct buttery flavor.

Paneer soaks up the sauce beautifully, making it one of the most popular paneer dishes in Indian restaurants and homes.</td>

                Chole is a classic Punjabi dish made with white chickpeas simmered in a robust, tangy, spiced gravy. In North India, this dish is commonly called chole masala or simply chole and is prepared in many households and eateries.

The word chana is the Hindi term for chickpeas, while chole is the Punjabi name. The term masala refers to a blend or mixture of spices and, in cooking, often indicates a spiced gravy.</td>

                This simple homemade Matar Paneer is a family recipe spiced to perfection and cooked with green peas (matar or mutter in Hindi), and paneer which is Indian cottage cheese. It is also known as Matar Paneer ki Sabji in Hindi.

It is a tasty Indian dish that I make often, as matar paneer – also known as mattar or mutter paneer is one of the most popular dishes from the North Indian cuisine.

                A samosa is a deep-fried Indian snack with a crisp, flaky crust and a savory filling –usually spiced potatoes and peas. Flaky and crunchy, samosas are among the most beloved street food snacks in North Indian cuisine.

They have a pastry-like shell and a comforting, spiced potato and green peas stuffing that makes them incredibly satisfying.
